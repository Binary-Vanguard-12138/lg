The following examples show various ways lg may be used to communicate with sensors via the GPIO.

Although many are complete programs they are intended to be a starting point in producing your own code, not an end point.

?1|C|lgpio C

Examples of C lgpio programs.

If your program is called foobar.c then build with

gcc -Wall-o foobar foobar.c -llgpio


?1|Python|lgpio Python

The lgpio Python code may be run on any Linux SBC with Python installed.  It allows control of the local GPIO.


?1|C|rgpio C

Examples of C rgpio programs.

If your program is called foobar.c then build with

gcc -Wall-o foobar foobar.c -lrgpio


?1|Python|rgpio Python

The rgpio Python code may be run on any SBC with Python installed.  It allows control of the GPIO on one or more networked SBCs.

The Python machine need not be Linux, it may run Windows, Mac, etc, anything as long as it supports Python.

Each SBC needs the rgpiod daemon to be running.  The rgpiod daemon may be started with the command rgpiod &.
